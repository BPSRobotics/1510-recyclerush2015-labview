---AUTONOMOUS---

We can have infinite; the more the better!

Requirements:
-Movement must be precise
-Robot can sense a tote that is ready to be picked up
-Robot can sense when it is close enough to place a tote on another tote

Tote Detection Methods: (prioritized)
-Tote Beam Breaker (only works for 1st tote because we would be holding)
-Camera (for distance to strafe left/right, move forward)
-Ultrasonic (to determine distance to tote)
-Track Encoder Distance, use to return to original position
