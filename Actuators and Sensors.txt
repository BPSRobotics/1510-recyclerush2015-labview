---ACTUATORS---

-4 Mecanum Drive CIM Motors (CANTalon 1-4)
-2 Lift CIM Motors (Talon PWM 0 and 1): must spin opposite of each other
-1 Clamp Bag Motor (Talon PWM 2)
-LEDs
	-Camera LEDs (Relay 0): yellow tote mask detection
	-Status LEDs (Relay 1): blinking if tote in front, on if tote grabbed


---SENSORS---

-Encoders (+- 6 error margin)
	-4 on drive (CANTalon SRX): drive distance
	-1 on lift (DI 0 and 1): not necessary, but useful for knowing lift distance
-Ultrasonic in front of robot (AI 0): detects something right in front of robot
-Limit Switches
	-5 on lift (AI 1): lift positions
	-2 on clamp ends (DI 2 and 3): clamp max and min position
-Beam Breakers
	-1 on clamp (DI 7): clamp wide tote position
-Camera
	-1 in front of robot (Hostname axis-bot.local): detects yellow tote mask with LED help
	-1 angled down from support pillar (Hostname axis-top.local): useful driving assistance
-(Accelerometer built-in to roboRIO: maybe useful for acceleration/velocity/distance/PID)
